## kata issue tracker

This project uses [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) as its shared issue
ledger. Run `kata quickstart` at the start of each session for the full agent
contract. The short version:

- Search before creating: `kata search "<keywords>" --agent`.
- Prefer updating existing issues over duplicates (`kata comment`, `kata label add`, `kata edit`).
- Default to `--agent` for ordinary reads and mutations; use `--json` only when a script needs structured data.
- Close only verified work: `kata close <ref> --done --message "<scope + verification>" --commit <sha>`.
- If work is incomplete, label `needs-review` and comment what remains rather than closing.
- Never `kata delete` or `kata purge` without explicit user authorization.
